1.	Item List: 
	-6x 10 Ohms linear potentiometers
	-adafruit servo shield: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1411
	-arduino mega
	-a six degrees of freedom robot arm: http://www.ebay.com/bhp/robot-arm-kit

	-4x10kg servos, 2x20kg servos
	-5V 15+A power supply to power robot arm's six servos
	-5v 1A power supply to power potentiometers
	-Two segments of 18 gauge wires to power servo shield
	-Power supply adapter and terminals
	-A bunch of 22 gauge wires to connect everything else
	-Soldering iron
	-Solder
	-Other components when necessary

2.	I used bamboo skewers to build the frame for my armature to connect to my arm.
	I bought some straps from Amazon to wrap the armature around my arm.
	I glued the potentiometers to the sticks with a glue gun.
	I used ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 for collision detection.
