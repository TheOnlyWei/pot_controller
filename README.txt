Remote manipulator for a robot arm

Inspired by: http://www.instructables.com/id/CONTROLLER-for-your-robotic-arm/

1.	This project uses 
	-adafruit servo shield
	-arduino mega
	-a six degrees of freedom robot arm
	-ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
	-4x10kg servos, 2x20kg servos
	-5V 15+A power supply recommended
	-A few 18 gauge wires for the main power supply
	-A bunch of 22 gauge wires
	-Other components when necessary

2.	I built an armature of sticks connected at the joints by
	potentiometers. The structure can be strapped to my arm 
	and used to remotely control a robot arm like a Waldo, AKA
	remote manipulator with complete access to all movements 
	of the robot arm.
	
	I used ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 for collision detection.
